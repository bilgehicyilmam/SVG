# SVG

**System Navigation**

This is the navigation system for SVG which explains the vectors.
The page is split into two parts. Left part includes the SVG, and the right part includes the HTML box field. In the box, there are explanations for vectors. On the right top of the page, there is a pink progress bar to show how many steps are taken. On the other hand, there is a navigation bar on the top of the page above the progress bar. The user can navigate to any SVG with this navigation system.

There are Forward, Backward, Refresh, and Replay buttons to navigate in the system.

Forward: This button allows the user to go forward.

Backward: This button allows the user to go backward.

Refresh: This button allows the user to refresh the page. It clears all SVG visualizations, text, and clears the progress bar.

Replay: This button allows the user to replay the latest SVG visualization in the page.

**Progress Bar**

There is a progress bar in pink color on the top left part of the page. It shows how many steps are taken and how many more steps left to finish all the visualizations. Pink boxes show how many steps are taken, and white boxes show how many steps left. When the user clicks on forward button one square field becomes pink, and the number of white fields decreased. On the other hand, when the user clicks on backward button one square field becomes white. Refresh button clears all the boxes – by turning all boxes to white. Replay button doesn’t change the progress bar.

**Navigation**

There is navigation bar on the top of the page. By clicking on the numbers, the user can navigate to that specific SVG. For example, when the user is navigating with Forward button, s/he can jump to any SVG by clicking on these numbers, and if s/he wants to move forward, the system goes forward from here.
On the other hand, the navigation bar allows the user to replay that specific SVG by clicking on these numbers.
